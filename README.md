wtf is going on here
====================

While I am competent with web frameworks like React and they certainly have their place on the web, I've always prided myself on being able to make simple, effective and efficient websites. I have a personal distaste for using a framework or a library just because you can. I don't believe good software is made when you put the solution ahead of the problem.  
  
In that spirit, this site is pure HTML and CSS and can run on any device from the past 20 years. It uses less memory and loads faster than the Google homepage. No compromises have been made on SEO or performance for the sake of cool animations. This site also makes full use of semantic HTML, so you won't find a single `<div>` anywhere in [](https://github.com/seansamarov/samarov.me)the source code. You'll also find that the template-like behavior of this site has been achieved with pure CSS (and would function perfectly as raw HTML)!  
  
I also obsess over responsive design - I encourage the user to resize their browser window on this site however they wish, and try to break the layout. If you do manage to break it, [leave me a note](https://samarov.me#contact) letting me know so I can fix it.
