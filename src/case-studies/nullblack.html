        A fast-paced, early-stage VPN startup where I was responsible for improving the company's online presence and establishing it as a serious competitor in a crowded market.

    <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul class="project-responsibilities">
        <li>UX Research</li>
        <li>Wireframing</li>
        <li>Prototyping</li>
        <li>Web Development</li>

        <li>Design System Maintenance</li>
        <li>UX Workshops</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p><a href="http://null.black">null.black</a> was a start-up consumer VPN company based in Fairfax, Virginia. Founded and operated mostly by college students, the company was intensely focused on user privacy and protecting political activists and journalists operating under oppressive regimes around the globe. </p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>The goal was simple, but not easy â€” take a promising high school project and turn it into a successful company. For me, that meant creating a new site that would convert new users and look professional while maintaining the rebellious hacker brand. I also knew that an essential part of a professional online presence was consistency, so I also created a design system to be used for the website, mobile app, and marketing materials.</p>
