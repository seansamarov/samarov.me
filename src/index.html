                 <p>
                    Since I was young, I have had a strong passion for music. I began taking piano lessons when I was 4 years old, and music has been a significant part of my life ever since. Over time, I developed a fondness for various music genres, and I have since crafted my own unique musical style, blending the subtle, dramatic, and emotive elements of classical music with the melodic release and energy of punk, rock, and metal music.

                    I started singing in 2015, began playing bass in 2019, and picked up the guitar in 2021. They say that once you've mastered the piano, you can learn any instrument, and that has certainly been true for me. My musical background has provided me with a lifelong passion and career, for which I am incredibly fortunate and grateful. Currently, I am performing in the southern Maine area and actively seeking new opportunities to showcase my talent. <a href="mailto:sean@samarov.me?subject=Performance Inquiry&body=When and where?">Feel free to get in touch with any opportunities or bookings</a>!

This site is built using only HTML and CSS, ensuring it can run on any device from the past 20 years. It's designed to use minimal memory and load quickly. I prioritize SEO and performance over flashy animations. Additionally, I use semantic HTML throughout the site and avoid using &lt;div&gt; tags in the source code. The template-like behavior is achieved purely with CSS and the site is designed to be fully responsive.
